#### The iterative process:
0. 
- Define the problem
- Assess the situation: _What are the requirements of the problem?, What are the assumptions and constraints?, What resources are available to you? What are the main costs associated with this project? What are the potential benefits? What risks are there in pursuing a project?What are the contingencies to potential risks?_
- Define goals of the project
1. **ACQUIRE**: 
- indentify data set
- Retrieve data: including finding, accessing, acquiring, and moving data
- Query data: ways to subset and match the data to regions or times of interests geospatial query.
2. **PREPARE**: Data Preparation (about the data quality and format)
- Exploring using statistic: Understand nature of data, preliminary analysis
- Pre-procceing data: (1) Data cleaning (to handle missing entries, garbage, nulls) (2) Intergrate (3) Package
