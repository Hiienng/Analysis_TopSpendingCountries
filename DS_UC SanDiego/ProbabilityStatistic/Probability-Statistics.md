## Topic 1: Introduction to Probability and Statistics
### 1.1 Introduction to Probability and Statistics
- Probability: tossing dice.
- Statistics: keeping scores in baseball.
- Certainty: Find the shortest route from A to B; Find all the pages that contain the words "Trump"
- Uncertainty: Find the fastest route from A to B; Find the 10 most related pages that contain the words "Trump"
### 1.2 What is Probability Theory
Ex: The probability of flipping a coin. If Head: xi = 1 and Tails: xi =-1, S1000 = x1 + x2 +... x1000

    def generate_count(k=1000, n=100):
      x=2*(random.rand(k,n)>0.5)-1
      s=sum(x,axis=0)
      return s
    
    k=1000
    n=1000
    counts=generate_counts(k=k,n=n)
    figure(figsize=[10,4])
    hist(counts);
    xlim([-k,k])
    xlabel("sum")
    ylabel("count")
    title("Histogram of coin flip sum when flipping a fair coin %d times"%k)
    grid()

- The ressults: Using probability theory we can calculate how small is ∣Sk|, k -> infinity then Sk -> 0 and |Sk| >= 4sqrt(k)
### 1.3 What is Statistics 
- Probability computes probabilities of complex events given the underlying base probabilities
- Statistics requires given data that was generated by a stochastic proces. Its analysing the data and drawwing the conclusions
    - Ex Using polls to estimate public opinion
    - Performing A/B test to design web page
    - Estimating the rate of global warming
#### Quiz
Which of the following describe the differences between probability and statistics?
- A. Probability predicts what will happen. Statistics, at least in part, uses what has already happened. **(TRUE)**
    - This statement accurately describes the difference between probability and statistics. Probability deals with predicting the likelihood of future events based on mathematical models and assumptions, whereas statistics involves analyzing and interpreting data from past events to make inferences and draw conclusions about the underlying population.
- b. Probability requires existing data. Statistics requires underlying models. **(FALSE)**
    - This statement is not entirely accurate. While probability theory does not require existing data, it does require assumptions about the underlying probability distributions of the events being studied. Statistics also relies on models, but these models are used to analyze existing data and draw inferences about the underlying population.
- c. Probability and statistics are two words describing the same thing.**(FALSE)**
