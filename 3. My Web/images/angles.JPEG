		Basel Farag is an iOS Engineer (he thinks). Besides GPU processors, robits and AI, Basel enjoys learning about computer science, astronomy and philosophy. He was once referred to as "the Daft Punk of people," a phrase whose meaning eludes him to this day, but which he's pretty sure is a compliment. 	</div>

</p>
<p>There’s an idea that’s been gaining ground in the tech community lately: Everyone should learn to code. But here’s the problem with that idea: Coding is not the new literacy.</p>
<p>If you regularly pay attention to the cultural shenanigans of Silicon Valley, you’ve no doubt heard of the “Learn to Code” movement. Politicians, nonprofit organizations like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/code-org">Code.org</a> and even former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City have evangelized what they view as a necessary skill for tomorrow’s workforce.</p>
<p>There may be some truth to that, especially since the United States’ need for engineers shows no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>But the picture is more complicated.</p>
<p>We live in an ultra-competitive world, with people turning to all sorts of methods to make ends meet. Selling coding as a ticket to economic salvation for the masses is dishonest.</p>
<p>Take coding bootcamps. Since the mainstream learned of the success of Silicon Valley software engineers, everyone wants to own a startup or become an engineer. HBO’s Silicon Valley paints a picture of late twenty-somethings spending their nights coding and smoking weed, all whilst making millions of dollars. The American public is amazed by figures like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who make millions seemingly overnight. Coding fever has even reached the steps of the White House, with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/30/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-computer-science-all-initiative-0">President Obama pushing for legislation</a> to include computer science in every public-school curriculum.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, it is not just bootcamps and politicians encouraging people to learn to code.</p>
<p>Individuals are actively encouraged to do so from all sides of society, from Hollywood to current tech luminaries. Despite this growing buzz, I view bootcamps with intense skepticism. While our culture tends to make Silicon Valley sexy, and glossy bootcamp brochures promise well-paying jobs, the truth is that many of these institutions are not accredited, do not post job statistics and do a poor job of ensuring their students’ post-bootcamp success. While many coding bootcamps are legitimate and care for their pupils, an even greater number are run by modern snake-oil salespeople tapping into the average American’s desperation.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			 I would no more urge everyone to learn to program than I would urge everyone to learn to plumb.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong; I do believe that engineering and programming are important skills. But only in the right context, and only for the type of person willing to put in the necessary blood, sweat and tears to succeed. The same could be said of many other skills. I would no more urge everyone to learn to program than I would urge everyone to learn to plumb.</p>
<p><strong>Focusing on coding inflates the importance of finding the “right” method to solve a problem rather than the importance of understanding the problem.</strong></p>
<p>Before we start working on a solution to a coding problem we must decide what the problem is &#8212; and if it’s truly a problem. If we let ourselves become fixated on how to solve a problem via code, regardless of if it is a programming problem or not, and lose sight of <em>why,</em> we gain nothing.</p>
<p>I have a close friend who is a former Association for Computing Machinery International Collegiate Programming Contest champion from Stanford. The greatest thing he taught me about his ACM championship days was the importance of understanding what problem you’re trying to solve.</p>
<p>You must ask yourself, &#8220;Do you even have one?&#8221; and &#8220;Can you apply the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-feynman-tufte-princip/">Feynman principle</a> and explain it in a way that others can understand you?&#8221;</p>
<p>This friend told me that even in the elite schools, students read the prompt to the coding problem only once then immediately code.</p>
<p>The year my friend won the championship he learned something: even those from elite schools dove headfirst into complicated problems, with code as their only weapon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my friend wrote his code only after thoroughly understanding the problem. He used almost all the allotted time to think about the problem. He did not write code until minutes before the deadline.</p>
<p>He became a champion.</p>
<p>He knew that banging out code would not solve the problem, but cool, collected problem solving would.</p>
<p><strong>An excessive focus on coding ignores the current plight of existing developers.</strong></p>
<p>Technology changes at a rapid pace in this industry.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago I was using Objective-C; now I code almost entirely in Swift. There are iOS developers applying for jobs right now who have never written a line of Objective-C. Swift is easier to learn, safer, uses modern development paradigms and is elegant in a way that Objective-C never was. The fact that new developers will never deal with Objective-C’s deficiencies is great, but it ignores the reality of the profession.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Don’t lose sight of reality while being charmed by our culture’s Silicon Valley romance.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Developers are expected to learn fast, with little guidance and little more incentive than the faint rattling of the pink-slip guillotine. One could argue that this is simply one of the costs of the trade. But if current developers are frustrated or falling behind &#8212; and there is evidence that shows this is the case &#8212; why encourage individuals to enter such an uncertain realm?</p>
<p>What happens to the person who spent night and day studying Objective-C only to be horrified by the Swift announcement at WWDC 2014? Do they keep coding in what is quickly becoming the language of lesser choice, or do they start again? If you’re a young twenty-something, this may pose little difficulty, but if you’re taking care of a family &#8212; with bills to pay and mouths to feed &#8212; the task becomes Herculean.</p>
<p>People in these situations confront all of this without a solid grasp of actual programming or engineering.</p>
<p><strong>The line between learning to code and getting paid to program as a profession is not an easy line to cross.</strong></p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>It took me more than a year of self-taught study before I got a freelance gig. Even then, the pay was poor. There were countless times I was refused even an interview because I didn’t have a computer science degree.</p>
<p>There were times when I could not afford a place to stay and had to rely on the kindness of friends to keep me going. There were many nights when I wanted to give up. But I found the strength to keep going.</p>
<p>It was &#8212; and is &#8212; persistence that allows me to stay in this field.</p>
<p>The truth is, it simply isn’t easy to slide into a development gig, even if it’s an apprenticeship. You need connections, people to vouch for you, a GitHub account maintained over time and more. Despite advances in equal opportunity, if you’re an underrepresented minority, you’re going to have to be twice as good as everyone else. And that’s simply to demonstrate competence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The gatekeepers are anywhere. They are Ivy League graduates who believe asking questions like, &#8220;How do you invert a binary tree?&#8221; is the best way to gauge someone’s technical ability. They are the whiteboard test-obsessed project managers (confession: I own multiple whiteboards) and the clueless HR managers who list requirements like, “5 years of Swift Programming Language Experience needed” in job postings (hint: Swift release = 2014). These people, for better or for worse, stand between you and a decent job.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there’s no other way to get past these people than to play their game, even if it is unfair.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>If becoming an engineer is what you want, don’t let me &#8212; or anyone, for that matter &#8212; get in the way of your goal. And don’t let traditional confinements like the educational system slow you down. There are no correct or incorrect ways to go about achieving your goals.</p>
<p>But don’t lose sight of reality while being charmed by our culture’s Silicon Valley romance. This field is not a get-out-of-debt-free card. You have to take the time to build your understanding of the field. You have to become comfortable with the fact that you are a problem-solver and not simply a “fill-in-framework-here” developer. You also must get used to the idea that at any moment you might need to learn a new framework or language, and that you will have to fight for a job if you don’t have formalized credentials.</p>
<p>Software engineering is a lucrative field, but the transformation from &#8220;coder&#8221; to &#8220;engineer&#8221; is challenging.</p>
<p>If you stick to it, you can not only change your life, but change your entire way of thinking.</p>

However, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing happen in the solo GP world, where investors, hearing about institutional investor risk appetite changing, are extending fundraising timelines, cutting investment vehicle targets or planning to leave venture altogether. Some have learned it the hard way, while others, like Sahil Lavingia, are telling LPs to literally cancel their checks if they feel guilty about investing in venture capital while the market rocks and interest rates boom.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a shift from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/14\/tiger-776-emerging-fund-manager\/\">the fund of fund mentality<\/a> that felt commonplace last year, in which investment firms cut checks to early-stage, experimental investors to de-risk and even lead first checks into a generation of new startups. Now, the idea of backing just one, feels like a harder sell \u2014 depending on which institution you\u2019re speaking to.<\/p>\n<p>For my full take on this burgeoning tension within the venture world read my TC+ column: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/25\/venture-capital-solo-gps\/\">\u201cAre solo GPs screwed?\u201d<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I know some of us are still reeling from the SVB mess, which is still very much unfolding. My hope with this piece is to offer nuance on how the market moves on from here for a very specific subset of check writers.

Representatives were often more interested in sharing their own opinions, posturing and shouting over the CEO&#8217;s answers to their questions, rather than attempting to learn any real intel about how TikTok works or what it does to protect its youngest users from harm.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, it seemed the hearing was more for show than any sort of fact-finding mission &#8212; these reps already had their minds made up, for the most part, about whether or not the app should be banned.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>During the hearing, however, a few legitimate questions were raised that had troubling responses. On the matter of Project Texas &#8212; TikTok&#8217;s plan to move all U.S. user data off of its own servers over to Oracle servers in the U.S. &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t clear how that would fully separate TikTok from its Chinese parent company ByteDance. As one line of questioning pointed out, TikTok employees use an internal software program known as Lark &#8212; a sort of Chinese Slack &#8212; to communicate with their ByteDance colleagues. TikTok&#8217;s CEO reports to ByteDance&#8217;s CEO, Liang Rubo. Chew also admitted that even under Project Texas there were exceptions that would allow data to leave the country for &#8220;interoperability purposes&#8221; and he would have to &#8220;get back to your team&#8221; on the specifics there. And when directly questioned about what sort of other software or IT services would still connect TikTok to ByteDance under Project Texas, Chew again said he would have to &#8220;get back to you&#8221; with his answers.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2518182\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2518182\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2518182\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Shou-Zi-Chew-e1679595213516.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew Testifies At U.S. House Hearing\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2518182\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Chip Somodevilla\/Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In addition, the exec couldn&#8217;t confirm where TikTok sells its data. Chew said he didn&#8217;t &#8220;believe&#8221; they sold to data brokers, but said he would have to &#8220;get back&#8221; to Congress on who they may actually sell to.<\/p>\n<p>While Chew may be correct that today&#8217;s TikTok isn&#8217;t doing more data collection than U.S. social giants, it&#8217;s being held to different standards. As a Chinese company with its hands on this data, there&#8217;s the potential for the CCP to meddle in TikTok&#8217;s operations, the politicians believe. Though that may not have happened yet, there is a threat posed by China&#8217;s 2017 <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Intelligence_Law_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Intelligence Law<\/a>, which compels businesses to assist in intelligence-gathering operations, if asked. TikTok claims it wouldn&#8217;t comply, but how could it not, if ByteDance is its parent?<\/p>\n<p>The House reps also asked a range of questions about minor safety. Ironically, it was TikTok that led the way in this area by being the first of the big social apps in the U.S. to roll out in-app parental controls and lock down teen accounts. Still, dangerous challenges have proliferated on its platform (though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2022\/03\/30\/facebook-tiktok-targeted-victory\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta was later revealed to have had a hand<\/a> in which ones made the news!). And like other algorithmic-based platforms, there&#8217;s always a danger that its recommendations could surface harmful content at times.<\/p>\n<p>However, some of the dangers of social media aren&#8217;t unique to TikTok alone. Social media usage overall is contributing to increased anxiety, depression, body dissatisfaction, disordered eating and other troubles, including suicide ideation, which is why it needs regulation or at least some basic guidelines. But today&#8217;s politicians don&#8217;t seem to be able to do the hard work of actually getting laws passed in this area, despite their bipartisan interest in doing so. They&#8217;d rather put on a show in Congress to make themselves look good to their potential voters so they can win their next election.<\/p>\n<h3>OpenAI launches ChatGPT plugins, and some of your favorite apps are already on board<\/h3>\n<p>OpenAI this week <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/23\/openai-connects-chatgpt-to-the-internet\/\">launched<\/a> plugins for ChatGPT, which allow the bot to access third-party databases and other sources of knowledge, including those on the web. The company said it would start with a small set of users before rolling out access to the still now alpha stage product more broadly. OpenAI is also hosting its own plugins, including a web browser and code interpreter and is now extending plugin access to developers on its waitlist.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hsLJgcBvtx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/23\/openai-connects-chatgpt-to-the-internet\/\">OpenAI connects ChatGPT to the internet<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;OpenAI connects ChatGPT to the internet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/23\/openai-connects-chatgpt-to-the-internet\/embed\/#?secret=5LTCWzuSBE#?secret=hsLJgcBvtx\" data-secret=\"hsLJgcBvtx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>A number of companies consumers know and love have already built plugins for ChatGPT, including Expedia, FiscalNote, Instacart, Kayak, Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram and Zapier. For example, OpenTable&#8217;s plugin can search across restaurants for available bookings, while the Instacart plugin can place orders from local stores.<\/p>\n<p>To get started, users pick a plugin to enable when they start a conversation on chat.openai.com. In a demo <a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/chatgpt-plugins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on OpenAI&#8217;s website<\/a>, it shows a user asking in plain language for &#8220;one great restaurant suggestion on Saturday&#8221; and &#8221; a simple recipe for Sunday&#8221; involving vegan food. The OpenTable plugin finds a local restaurant with a reservation, then follows detailed requests for returning the recipe info and ordering ingredients on Instacart. (If only this technology was available in Siri!) It&#8217;s easy to imagine a future where you could one day interact with these services through AI commands, not by tapping around on apps&#8217; screens. And being able to talk naturally to the AI could make services easier to use for everyone, not just the technically inclined.<\/p>\n<h3>Microsoft plans a mobile games store<\/h3>\n<p>Microsoft is betting that incoming tech regulations will allow it a way to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/20\/microsoft-banks-on-regulations-to-build-a-mobile-games-store\/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=WPunit\">compete in the mobile gaming market<\/a> alongside Apple and Google (and likely Epic Games, if things go its way). In an interview with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/7707705e-b288-4531-b30d-7fa993325018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Financial Times<\/a> this week, Microsoft gaming head Phil Spencer noted that the EU\u2019s Digital Market Act (DMA) is expected to go into effect next March, which would allow companies to load their own app stores on Apple and Android devices. And Microsoft wants to do just that.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to be in a position to offer Xbox and content from both us and our third-party partners across any screen where somebody would want to play,&#8221; Spencer told the FT.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft had already hinted at its plans to launch an Xbox-branded mobile game store that would leverage content from Activision Blizzard &#8212; assuming that deal gains regulatory approval. The game maker&#8217;s IP could help Microsoft seed a new game store thanks to its titles like Call of Duty Mobile and those from the Candy Crush franchise. Microsoft has also acquired a number of gaming studios over the past several years, including Ninja Theory, Playground Games and Bethesda owner Zenimax Media.<\/p>\n<p>If things progress as planned, the mobile apps and games market could have an entirely different shape in the years ahead. Netflix is also seemingly betting on this change,<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/20\/netflix-release-40-more-games-this-year-add-monument-valley-2024\/\"> prepping its own vast library of games<\/a> that come with a Netflix membership. For the time being, the games are just a perk of membership, but if one day Netflix could launch its own games store and fill it with titles, it seems it may choose to expand to paid games as well.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"i3pI4Ay07H\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/20\/microsoft-banks-on-regulations-to-build-a-mobile-games-store\/\">Microsoft banks on regulations to build a mobile games store<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Microsoft banks on regulations to build a mobile games store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/20\/microsoft-banks-on-regulations-to-build-a-mobile-games-store\/embed\/#?secret=DvX6EACj3C#?secret=i3pI4Ay07H\" data-secret=\"i3pI4Ay07H\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h1>Platforms<\/h1>\n<h3>Google<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google says it <a href=\"http:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2023\/03\/play-commerce-prevented-fraudulent-and-abusive-transactions-in-2022.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prevented over $2 billion<\/a> in fraudulent and abusive transactions via Play Commerce last year<\/strong>, in an update likely designed to convince developers to not switch to third-party billing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Google <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/24\/google-removes-hundreds-of-kenya-focused-loan-apps-from-play-store\/\">took down hundreds of loan apps<\/a> from the Play Store in Kenya<\/strong> following the launch of a new policy, which requires digital lenders in the East African country to submit proof of a license to operate.

Zi Chew&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/23\/tiktok-gears-up-for-its-big-day-in-congress\/\">brutal five hour Congressional hearing<\/a> on Thursday, TikToker and disinformation

In one instance, Representative Richard Hudson (R-NC) asked Chew if TikTok connects to a user&#8217;s home wi-fi network. Chew responded, bewildered, &#8220;Only if the user turns on the wi-fi.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The ignorant questions weren&#8217;t unique to the government&#8217;s interrogation of Chew. At a high-profile hearing 2018, the late Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) infamously asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg how Facebook makes money if the app is free. Zuckerberg responded, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=n2H8wx1aBiQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Senator, we run ads<\/a>,&#8221; failing to stifle a smirk. During a tech hearing two years ago, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) created another <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/morroweric\/status\/1443628623576109065\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notorious viral moment<\/a> by asking Facebook&#8217;s global head of safety if she would &#8220;commit to ending finsta.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As entertaining as these lapses in basic knowledge are, TikTok creators have serious concerns about the future of an app that&#8217;s given them a community, and, in some cases, a career.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok creator Vitus &#8220;V&#8221; Spehar, known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@underthedesknews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Under the Desk News<\/a>, has amassed 2.9 million followers by sharing global news in an approachable way. But in this week&#8217;s news cycle, they&#8217;re front-and-center (literally \u2014 they sat <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@underthedesknews\/video\/7214117250947763499\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">right behind<\/a> the TikTok CEO as he testified).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s really concerning that a government is considering removing American citizens from the global conversation on an app as robust as TikTok,&#8221; Spehar told TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just banning the app in the United States, it means disconnecting American citizens from Canada, the UK, Mexico, Iran, Ukraine and all of the frontline reporting you see from those countries, it just shows up on our [For You Page].&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Spehar is part of a group of TikTok creators who travelled to Washington, D.C. this week to advocate on TikTok&#8217;s behalf \u2014 and against the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/16\/the-us-government-ramps-up-its-pressure-campaign-against-tiktok\/\">looming threat of a national ban<\/a>. They participated in a press conference on Wednesday afternoon hosted by Representative Jamaal Bowman (D-NY), a rare dissenting voice in Congress who raised questions about what he described as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@repbowman\/video\/7213533080643013931?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;hysteria and panic&#8221;<\/a> surrounding TikTok.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2518422\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2518422\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2518422\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/GettyImages-1249086286-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Vitus Spehar, host of the TikTok channel Under The News Desk, hosts a live stream during a news conference outside the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, March 22, 2023.\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/GettyImages-1249086286-1.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/GettyImages-1249086286-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/GettyImages-1249086286-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/GettyImages-1249086286-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/GettyImages-1249086286-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/GettyImages-1249086286-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/GettyImages-1249086286-1.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/GettyImages-1249086286-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2518422\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vitus Spehar, host of the TikTok channel Under The News Desk, hosts a live stream during a news conference outside the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, March 22, 2023. (Nathan Howard\/Bloomberg)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Congress made clear that they don&#8217;t understand TikTok, they don&#8217;t listen to their constituents who are in the community of TikTokers \u2014 and are using this TikTok hysteria as a way to pass legislation that gives them superpowers to ban any app they deem &#8216;unsafe&#8217; in the future,&#8221; Spehar said following the hearing.<\/p>\n<p>Tech ethicists and creators alike share this frustration. Dr. Casey Fiesler, a University of Colorado Boulder professor of tech ethics and policy, believes that the national security concerns about the app are overstated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The risk seems to be entirely speculative right now and to me, I&#8217;m not sure how it is substantially worse than all of the things that are troubling about social media right now that the government has not been focusing on,&#8221; Fiesler said. She commands an audience of over 100,000 followers on TikTok, where she explores issues like the nuances of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@professorcasey\/video\/7214109543847038250?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content moderation <\/a>and other topics that might come up in her graduate courses.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any way to frame this as a general data privacy issue without going after every other tech company,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@professorcasey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fiesler<\/a> told TechCrunch. &#8220;The only thing that makes sense is that it&#8217;s literally only about the fact that the company is based in China.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There is still no evidence that TikTok has shared data with the Chinese government. But reports have shown that employees at TikTok&#8217;s Beijing-based parent company ByteDance have viewed American user data. An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/emilybakerwhite\/tiktok-tapes-us-user-data-china-bytedance-access\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investigation<\/a> last year revealed that engineers in China had open access to TikTok data on U.S. users, undermining the company&#8217;s claims to the contrary. Another <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/emilybaker-white\/2022\/10\/20\/tiktok-bytedance-surveillance-american-user-data\/?sh=59fb6a696c2d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/12\/22\/technology\/byte-dance-tik-tok-internal-investigation.html?smid=tw-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">corroborated<\/a> by ByteDance, found that a small group of engineers inappropriately accessed two U.S. journalists&#8217; TikTok data. They planned to use the location information to determine if the reporters had crossed paths with any ByteDance employees who may have leaked information to the press.<\/p>\n<p>Still, TikTokers point to the distinction between sharing data with a private Chinese company and the Chinese government. For its part, TikTok has tried to appease U.S. officials with a plan called Project Texas, a $1.5 billion undertaking that will move U.S. users\u2019 data to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/17\/tiktok-oracle-us-traffic-china-access\/\">Oracle servers<\/a>. Project Texas would also create a subsidiary of the company called the TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., which plans to oversee any aspect of TikTok involving national security.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--tiktok\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@professorcasey\/video\/7213871622749490474\" data-video-id=\"7213871622749490474\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" >\n<section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@professorcasey\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@professorcasey?refer=embed\">@professorcasey<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>TikTok hearing thoughts.

Children died from this behavior after it circulated on TikTok, but the game didn&#8217;t originate on the platform: As early as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/media\/pressrel\/2008\/r080214.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2008<\/a>, the CDC warned parents that 82 children had died from a trend called &#8220;the choking game.&#8221; One congressman even referenced &#8220;NyQuil chicken&#8221; as a dangerous TikTok trend, despite the fact that there is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/21\/nyquil-chicken-fda-warning-tiktok-trend\/\">little evidence<\/a>\u00a0anyone actually ate chicken soaked in cough medicine and the trend originated years ago on 4chan.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The moral panic over TikTok challenges is something I&#8217;ve debunked extensively, and then they just get parroted by these politicians that don&#8217;t understand what a moral panic is,&#8221; Richards told TechCrunch. &#8220;To utilize misinformation that I&#8217;ve written about so much and tried to debunk, and to see it used against TikTok was just so infuriating.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Richards does acknowledge that TikTok&#8217;s best feature is also its worst: Anything can go viral. She believes TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; information environment does lend itself to misinformation, but that same dynamic also surfaces good content that would never get exposure on a different social network.<\/p>\n<p>Richards is also a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@tofology\/video\/6997932573313879302?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vocal critic<\/a> of TikTok&#8217;s content moderation policies, which &#8212; like every other social network &#8212; are not always applied evenly. During Thursday&#8217;s hearing, Rep. Kat Cammack (R-FL) dramatically screened a month-old TikTok video depicting a gun alongside text threatening the leader of the House Committee that orchestrated Chew&#8217;s testimony. It&#8217;s an obvious violation of TikTok&#8217;s content guidelines, but Richards points out that it had very little engagement.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In the context of TikTok, something having 40 likes is effective moderation,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;That means the video isn&#8217;t reaching very many people.&#8221; She believes that a video like the one the Florida lawmaker highlighted shouldn&#8217;t be on the platform at all, but ultimately if it doesn&#8217;t reach many users then the potential for harm is limited.<\/p>\n<p>Other creators expressed frustration that congresspeople failed to consider how TikTok has helped Americans, like LGBTQ+ people who found community on the app or small business owners who were able to grow beyond their wildest dreams after going viral.<\/p>\n<p>Trans Latina creator <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@naomiheartsxo?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Naomi Hearts<\/a>, who has 1 million TikTok followers, was invited by TikTok to support the app in D.C. (TikTok compensated this group of creators, which included Spehar, by covering lodging and travel costs). She said that she met other TikTokers on the trip who used the app to gain traction for their small businesses.<\/p>\n<p>She too found an audience on TikTok that she wasn&#8217;t able to build elsewhere, after struggling to grow a following on Instagram. But on TikTok, even small accounts have the potential to go viral, a phenomenon that can jumpstart a career when things work out.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The message of the normal person&#8230; for example, me, who was just a plus sized trans woman who grew up in South Central Los Angeles and had a dream \u2014 my message was not there,&#8221; Naomi Hearts said, referring to Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Spehar also emphasized the role that TikTok plays in helping people connect well outside the bounds of their everyday surroundings.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You can find communities that you can&#8217;t where you live,&#8221; Spehar said. &#8220;I think about kids in Northwest Arkansas and in Tennessee &#8212; TikTok is literally one of the reasons they&#8217;re not taking their lives, because they know they&#8217;re not alone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Although Richards mostly writes about disinformation on TikTok, she laments the positive sides of the app that could be lost if it gets banned in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Banning TikTok would ultimately harm marginalized communities the most, who are least represented by institutional news and organizations,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;And if all of a sudden, that entire infrastructure disappears, they will just suddenly in be the dark.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the aftermath of TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew&#8217;s brutal five hour Congressional hearing on Thursday, TikToker and disinformation researcher Abbie Richards summed up what so many creators were thinking: &#8220;It&#8217;s actually remarkable how much less Congress knows about social media than the average person,&#8221; Richards told TechCrunch.

The blockchain is compatible with Solidity, a language developers use to code, and allows them to build projects that can communicate across multiple networks. Hundreds of <a href=\"https:\/\/core.app\/discover\/projects\/all\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">projects<\/a> are a part of the Avalanche ecosystem, ranging from decentralized exchanges like 1inch to digital asset security firms like BitGo.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of total value locked (TVL), Avalanche is currently the seventh-largest blockchain, with more than $1.1 billion secured across a $5.72 billion market cap, according to CoinMarketCap <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/chain-ranking\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The present and future of L1s<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The company sees its underlying tech as a key driver for developer attention. \u201cLooking around I decided we have to come up with our own architecture for scaling that no one else seems to be pushing at the moment,\u201d G\u00fcn Sirer said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Thus, a \u201cmarriage\u201d of Avalanche\u2019s consensus with its subnet architecture, which allows us to have multiple parallel chains dedicated to their own use cases, was born. \u201cThat coupling was the genesis of what I thought was a brand new approach,\u201d G\u00fcn Sirer added.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, Ava Labs has had one major focus. \u201cThe north star for us is to digitize all of the world\u2019s assets on the Avalanche blockchain,\u201d G\u00fcn Sirer said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we set out to do and that\u2019s what I\u2019m so excited about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, a number of L1 blockchains have popped up across the crypto ecosystem, but G\u00fcn Sirer believes in three to five years from now the abundance of L1 blockchains will \u201cbe played out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think we already have way too many L1s and they\u2019re essentially copying other people\u2019s playbooks,\u201d G\u00fcn Sirer said. \u201cIn many cases, they\u2019re bringing something to the market that the market did not ask for.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s needed to make a good L1?<\/p>\n<p>It has to be decentralized, secure and fast, G\u00fcn Sirer noted. \u201cI think we\u2019re in a good spot and I think people are going to converge,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>We also talked about G\u00fcn Sirer&#8217;s background, why he launched the layer-1 blockchain, Avalanche, in 2020, whether the space has too many L1s and how blockchains can scale more efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>And we discussed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How the layer-2 vision is broken<\/li>\n<li>U.S. regulatory crackdown on crypto<\/li>\n<li>Ava Labs\u2019 growth in Asian markets<\/li>\n<li>The blockchain\u2019s partnerships and business development<\/li>\n<li>Ava Labs\u2019 focal point for 2023 and beyond<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Articles mentioned during the episode can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/11\/aws-partners-with-avalanche-to-scale-blockchain-solutions-for-enterprises-governments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/13\/kkr-dives-into-avalanche-blockchain-to-tokenize-and-democratize-financial-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Chain Reaction comes out every other Thursday at 12:00 p.m. PT, so be sure to subscribe to us on<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/chain-reaction\/id1616008890\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Apple Podcasts,<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/6dC9jw0YyPqnul5P3CECoN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify<\/a> or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest in web3 and crypto.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to Chain Reaction, a podcast that interviews newsmakers in crypto to better understand the tech behind the hype and the people working to build a decentralized future.

Besides GPU processors, robits and AI, Basel enjoys learning about computer science, astronomy and philosophy. He was once referred to as \"the Daft Punk of people,\" a phrase whose meaning eludes him to this day, but which he's pretty sure is a compliment. \t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been gaining ground in the tech community lately: Everyone should learn to code.\u00a0But here\u2019s the problem with that idea: Coding is not the new literacy.<\/p>\n<p>If you regularly pay attention to the cultural shenanigans of Silicon Valley, you\u2019ve no doubt heard of the \u201cLearn to Code\u201d movement. Politicians, nonprofit organizations like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/code-org\">Code.org<\/a> and even former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City have evangelized what they view as a necessary skill for tomorrow\u2019s workforce.<\/p>\n<p>There may be some truth to that, especially since the United States\u2019 need for engineers shows no sign of slowing down.<\/p>\n<p>But the picture is more complicated.<\/p>\n<p>We live in an ultra-competitive world, with people turning to all sorts of methods to make ends meet. Selling coding as a ticket to economic salvation for the masses is dishonest.<\/p>\n<p>Take coding bootcamps. Since the mainstream learned of the success of Silicon Valley software engineers, everyone wants to own a startup or become an engineer. HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley paints a picture of late twenty-somethings spending their nights coding and smoking weed, all whilst making millions of dollars. The American public is amazed by figures like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who make millions seemingly overnight. Coding fever has even reached the steps of the White House, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2016\/01\/30\/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-computer-science-all-initiative-0\">President Obama pushing for\u00a0legislation<\/a>\u00a0to include computer science in every public-school curriculum.<\/p>\n<p>Inexplicably, it is not just bootcamps and politicians encouraging people to learn to code.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals are actively encouraged to do so from all sides of society, from Hollywood to current tech luminaries. Despite this growing buzz, I view bootcamps with intense skepticism. While our culture tends to make Silicon Valley sexy, and\u00a0glossy bootcamp brochures\u00a0promise well-paying jobs, the truth is that many of these institutions are not accredited, do not post job statistics and do a poor job of ensuring their students\u2019 post-bootcamp success.\u00a0While many coding\u00a0bootcamps are legitimate\u00a0and care for their pupils, an even greater number are run by modern snake-oil salespeople tapping into the average American\u2019s desperation.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t I would no more urge everyone to learn to program than I would urge everyone to learn to plumb.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong; I do believe that engineering and programming are important skills. But only in the right context, and only for the type of person willing to put in the necessary blood, sweat and tears to succeed. The same could be said of many other skills. I would no more urge everyone to learn to program than I would urge everyone to learn to plumb.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Focusing on coding inflates the importance of finding the \u201cright\u201d method to solve a problem rather than the importance of understanding the problem.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before we start working on a solution to a coding problem we\u00a0must decide what the problem is &#8212; and if it\u2019s truly a problem. If we let ourselves become fixated on how to solve a problem via code, regardless of if it is a programming problem or not, and lose sight of <em>why,<\/em> we gain nothing.<\/p>\n<p>I have a close friend who is a former\u00a0Association for Computing Machinery International Collegiate Programming Contest\u00a0champion from Stanford. The greatest thing he taught me about his ACM championship days was the importance of understanding what problem you\u2019re trying to solve.<\/p>\n<p>You must ask yourself, &#8220;Do you even have one?&#8221; and &#8220;Can you apply the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/the-feynman-tufte-princip\/\">Feynman principle<\/a>\u00a0and explain it in a way that others can understand you?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This friend told me that even in the elite schools, students read the prompt to the coding problem only once then immediately code.<\/p>\n<p>The year my friend won the championship he learned something: even those from elite schools dove headfirst into complicated problems, with code as their only weapon.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, my friend wrote his code only after thoroughly understanding the problem. He used almost all\u00a0the allotted time to think about the problem. He did not write code until minutes before the deadline.<\/p>\n<p>He became a champion.<\/p>\n<p>He knew that banging out code would not solve the problem, but cool, collected problem solving would.<\/p>\n<p><strong>An excessive focus on coding ignores the current plight of existing developers.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Technology changes at a rapid pace in this industry.<\/p>\n<p>Just a few years ago I was using Objective-C; now I code almost entirely in Swift. There are iOS developers applying for jobs right now who have never written a line of Objective-C. Swift is easier to learn, safer, uses modern development paradigms and is elegant in a way that Objective-C never was. The fact that new developers will never deal with Objective-C\u2019s deficiencies is\u00a0great, but it ignores the reality of the profession.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tDon\u2019t lose sight of reality while being charmed by our culture\u2019s Silicon Valley romance.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Developers are expected to learn fast, with little guidance and little more incentive than the faint rattling of the pink-slip guillotine. One could argue that this is simply one of the costs of the trade. But if current developers are frustrated or falling behind &#8212; and there is evidence that shows this\u00a0is the case &#8212;\u00a0why encourage individuals to enter such an uncertain realm?<\/p>\n<p>What happens to the person who spent night and day studying Objective-C only to be horrified by the Swift announcement at WWDC 2014? Do they keep coding in what is quickly becoming the language of lesser choice, or do they start again? If you\u2019re a young twenty-something, this may pose little difficulty, but if you\u2019re taking care of a family &#8212; with bills to pay and mouths to feed &#8212; the task becomes Herculean.<\/p>\n<p>People in these situations confront all of this without a solid grasp of actual programming or engineering.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The line between learning to code and getting paid to program as a profession is not an easy line to cross.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Really.<\/p>\n<p>It took me more than\u00a0a year of self-taught study before I got a freelance gig. Even then, the pay was poor. There were countless times I was refused even an interview because I didn\u2019t have a computer science degree.<\/p>\n<p>There were times when I could not afford a place to stay and had to rely on the kindness of friends to keep me going. There were many nights\u00a0when I wanted to give up. But I found the strength to keep going.<\/p>\n<p>It was &#8212; and is &#8212; persistence that allows me to stay in this field.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, it simply isn\u2019t easy to slide into a development gig, even if it\u2019s an apprenticeship. You need connections, people to vouch for you, a GitHub account\u00a0maintained over time and more. Despite advances in equal opportunity, if you\u2019re an underrepresented minority, you\u2019re going to have to be twice as good as everyone else. And that\u2019s simply to demonstrate competence.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>The gatekeepers are anywhere. They are Ivy League graduates who believe asking questions like, &#8220;How do you invert a binary tree?&#8221; is the best way to gauge someone\u2019s technical ability. They are the whiteboard test-obsessed project managers (confession: I own multiple whiteboards) and the clueless HR managers who list requirements like, \u201c5 years of Swift Programming Language Experience needed\u201d in job postings (hint: Swift release = 2014). These people, for better or for worse, stand between you and a decent job.<\/p>\n<p>As far as I know, there\u2019s no other way to get past these people than to play their game, even if it is unfair.<\/p>\n<h2>Final thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>If becoming an engineer is what you want, don\u2019t let me &#8212; or anyone, for that matter &#8212; get in the way of your goal. And don\u2019t let traditional confinements like the educational system slow you down. There are no correct or incorrect ways to go about achieving your goals.<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t lose sight of reality while being charmed by our culture\u2019s Silicon Valley romance. This field is not a get-out-of-debt-free card. You have to take the time to build your understanding of the field. You have to become comfortable with the fact that you are a problem-solver and not simply a \u201cfill-in-framework-here\u201d developer. You also must get used to the idea that at any moment you might need to learn a new framework or language, and that you will have to fight for a job if you don\u2019t have formalized credentials.<\/p>\n<p>Software engineering is a lucrative field, but the transformation from &#8220;coder&#8221; to &#8220;engineer&#8221; is challenging.<\/p>\n<p>If you stick to it, you can not only change your life, but change your entire way of thinking.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been gaining ground in the tech community lately: Everyone should learn to code.
