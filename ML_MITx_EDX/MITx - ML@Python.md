#### 5. Exercise - Neutral Netwwork
Here, we will write a function neural_network, which will apply a neural network operation with 2 inputs and 1 output and a given weight matrix.
**Available Functions:** You have access to the NumPy python library as np
Your function should take two arguments: inputs and weights, two NumPy arrays of shape (2,1) and should return a NumPy array of shape (1,1), the output of the neural network. Do not forget the tanh activation.
**Grader note**: If the grader appears unresponsive and displays â€œProcessing", it means (most likely) it has crashed. Please resubmit your answers, and leave a message in the forum and we will work on fixing it as soon as possible.

        def neural_network(inputs, weights):
            """
             Takes an input vector and runs it through a 1-layer neural network
             with a given weight matrix and returns the output.

             Arg:
               inputs - 2 x 1 NumPy array
               weights - 2 x 1 NumPy array
             Returns (in this order):
               out - a 1 x 1 NumPy array, representing the output of the neural network
            """
            wT = np.transpose(weights)
            prod = np.matmul(wT, inputs)
            out = np.tanh(prod)
            return (out)
            # Alternatively:
            # return np.tanh(weights.T @ inputs)
            # or even:
            # return np.tanh(np.dot(inputs.T, weights))

## Unit 1 Linear Classifiers and Generalizations
At the end of this lecture, you will be able to
- understand the goal of machine learning from a movie recommender example
- understand elements of supervised learning, and the difference between the training set and the test set
- understand the difference of classification and regression - two representative kinds of supervised learning
